## 📋 About The Project

[cite_start]Many students struggle with managing their study time, which often leads to cramming and anxiety. [cite: 33] [cite_start]Acadia addresses this by acting as an intelligent assistant. [cite: 72] [cite_start]The application takes user inputs such as subjects, their perceived difficulty, exam dates, and available study times. [cite: 74, 172] [cite_start]It then uses a smart scheduling algorithm to generate a clear, customized, and manageable weekly study plan that prioritizes more difficult and urgent tasks. [cite: 75, 76, 173]
